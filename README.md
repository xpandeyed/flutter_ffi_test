Dart FFI (Foreign Function Interface) can be used for calling functions in C++ files from Dart code. The FFI library allows Dart code to interoperate with C code, including C++ code.

In order to use FFI with C++ code, you need to make sure that your C++ code has a C-compatible interface. This means that the function signatures and calling conventions used in your C++ code need to be compatible with C. You can achieve this by using the extern "C" declaration in your C++ code.
